            <p><b>Somesh Sahu</b> (born in Odisha, India) is an Indian learner, technology enthusiast, and aspiring
                author.
                He holds a diploma in Electrical Engineering from Adarsha College of Engineering and a Post Graduate
                Diploma in Computer Applications from ITCT Angul.</p>

            <p>Sahu began his professional journey as a Data Verifier at the District Court Digitization Hub (DCDH) in
                Angul. In this role, he worked on categorizing case types, labeling documents, and improving
                record-keeping
                accuracy. His time there gave him experience in managing information, paying attention to details, and
                streamlining data-entry processes with self-developed tools.
            </p>
            <p>After this, he shifted his focus fully to learning and upskilling. He is currently studying <i>frontend
                    development</i>, including <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>, with the aim of building practical,
                user-friendly
                web applications. Alongside frontend, he explores <b>Python programming</b> for data handling and
                automation.
                He also experiments with organizing systems, using tools like **Obsidian** to design personal workflows
                for
                journaling, note-taking, and project management.</p>

            <p>Sahu’s interests extend to writing and creative work. He is working on his first book, <b>Hence
                    Proved</b>,
                which
                collects his reflections on life lessons and personal growth.</p>

            <p> He has expressed a long-term goal of combining his technical skills with storytelling and creativity. By
                doing so, Sahu hopes to move toward projects that are both <b>practical in technology</b> and
                <i>meaningful in expression</i>, reflecting his dual interest in structured systems and human
                experiences.
            </p>
