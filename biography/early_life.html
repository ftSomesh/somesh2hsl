            <h4>Natal Nostalgia</h4>
            <p>
                I was born on <span class="hash">10th of December, 2004</span> when my mother and I
                shared our first tears together, and in that moment, she became my
                <span class="chip-good">first love</span>. This might have made
                <span class="highlight">everyone (the reader)</span> confused, because there was no
                need to mention her as my first love—everyone knew, and the word
                <q class="highlight">mother</q> had always been everyone’s first love.
                Her name was <span class="marker">Gelha Sahu</span>.
                She was quite silent and trustworthy with a percent of
                <span class="chip-good">101%</span>.
                Trust me, my maths was not weak—<span class="chip-warn">maybe you weren’t good at math</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Her nature was as simple as the maximum you could estimate. Though she lived in a village
                <span class="hash">15 km away</span> from my city where I used to work,
                she cared for my health just like someone who lived outside the country,
                <span class="soft">which others couldn’t</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let me take you back to my childhood—when <span class="chip-good">securing a good mark</span>
                meant nothing to me, when no one forced me to get good marks as
                <span class="marker">Sharmaji’s son</span> was also a backbencher, when
                <span class="shadow-box">hide-and-seek</span> was the ultimate thrill with top secret spots,
                when objects turned into imaginative playthings every day,
                when <span class="chip-good">riding bicycles with friends</span> meant a sense of freedom,
                when <span class="highlight">summer vacations</span> meant carefree days, carefree life,
                when <span class="soft">birthdays</span> were more than just a date on the calendar.
            </p>

            <p>
                At first, I was fond of <span class="marker">Parle-G biscuits</span>.
                My father brought <span class="hash">two biscuits</span>,
                one for breakfast and the second one which they gave me only when I promised,
                <q class="highlight">I wouldn’t be absent from school on that particular day.</q>
                This was how they convinced me when I kept behaving badly and refused to attend classes.
                Wasn’t it <span class="chip-bad">ugly enough</span>? No, perhaps it was not.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bou (mother) said my father had tried a lot to make me sleep on his belly,
                but every time he failed. From my parents I learned that my siblings often slept on his belly,
                but I always tried to keep sleeping beside my <span class="chip-good">Bou</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                My village, <span class="marker">Sankhapur</span>, was known for its
                <span class="chip-good">vibrant culture</span>,
                <span class="soft">warm-hearted people</span>, and festivals, especially the
                <span class="highlight">Panchodola fair</span>. It was the heart of the Panchayat,
                which included two villages—<span class="marker">Kahalgaon</span> and Sankhapur—both surrounded by
                greenery.
                When I was a child, it seemed that nearly everyone depended on
                <span class="hash">farming</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                My father was one of the <span class="chip-good">well-respected farmers</span> in our village.
                He was known for his <span class="chip-good">strong build</span>, hard work, and kindness.
                I remembered admiring his <span class="shadow-box">strong arms</span>, which seemed to represent
                all the strength and love he put into his work.
                When I was about to finish Class 10, he stopped farming, but people still remembered him
                as one of the <span class="highlight">best</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Later on, he didn’t work but spent his time visiting our roadside properties,
                which we rented out to local shopkeepers selling things like
                <span class="marker">fish, mutton, chicken</span>, and other goods.
                Whenever I visited the village, I rarely looked at the shops, but my father often stopped by,
                <span class="soft">reconnecting with the village he loved</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                During my childhood, there was a teacher named <span class="marker">Muni Apa</span>
                who was famous for her strict teaching style. People used to tease her playfully, singing,
                <q class="highlight">Munni Badnaam Hui, Darling Tere Liye</q>.
                One day, while my mother and I were returning from the fields,
                we stopped by her house. She was kind that day, offering me a banana,
                which I still remembered eating there. Not long after, I joined her class,
                where many of my friends—<span class="hash">Tuin, Raja, Samir, Kanha, and Siba</span>—were already
                learning.
            </p>

            <p>
                Summer days back then felt like they would never end, filled with games and laughter.
                We played <span class="marker">goli (marbles)</span>, cricket, long jump, chor-police, hide-and-seek
                with our secret hiding spots, and many more games.
                I was decent at most games, but in <span class="chip-good">cricket</span>,
                I had a bit of a reputation among my friends. Samir and I were always on the same team,
                with him as the <span class="chip-good">captain</span>.
                He had a <span class="highlight">natural ability to lead</span>
                and stepped in whenever arguments arose, keeping the team united.
                After each game, he talked to me about my mistakes, offering advice on how to improve.
            </p>

            <h4>Guardians Unveiled</h4>
            <p>
                In my early years, two figures stood as the pillars of my upbringing: my father and my own sister
                <span class="badge">Lucky</span>. While many would look to their parents as the primary guides in life,
                for me, it was these two who shaped my understanding of the world in my childhood.
                They were the guardians who were tasked with the responsibility of teaching me how important
                <span class="underline">education</span> was in one’s life.
                <span class="badge">Lucky</span>, with her quiet strength, was the one who often didn’t speak much about
                the lessons she imparted, but her actions spoke louder than words.
                Her approach to teaching me was <span class="chip-warn">strict</span>.
                She was the one who fought with me for a biscuit and fed me the one I hadn’t tasted
                by sacrificing her own piece.
                <span class="badge">Papa</span>, on the other hand, was a different story.
                He spoke louder and didn’t take much action that would let me pay attention to my studies,
                but he expected a lot.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="badge">Sumi Dee</span>, whom I respected a lot and argued with the most,
                had a relationship with me that was often marked by <span class="chip-bad">misunderstandings</span>,
                creating a gap that we both struggled to bridge.
                She held high expectations for me, especially when it came to helping her children with their
                studies—helping them
                in lessons, projects, reading, and finding appropriate answers.
                It wasn’t a request but an <span class="inverse">obligation</span> in her eyes,
                one that I sometimes found difficult to fulfill.
                She cared for me since late 2020, treating me like her own son.
                She provided me with <span class="chip-good">food</span>, <span class="chip-good">shelter</span>,
                and the <span class="chip-good">freedom</span> to read and write whenever I wanted.
                Despite her kindness, there were moments when I doubted her intentions and argued, causing her stress.
                In <span class="hash">November 2024</span>, she even expressed her frustration to my parents, saying,
                <span class="mono">“I can’t keep him with me anymore.”</span>
                Yet, after our conversation that day, she asked me to stay.
            </p>

            <p>
                But wait—I was getting ahead of myself. I meant only to introduce her.
                She was one of the most significant characters in this book, and no matter how much I wrote about her,
                it never felt enough. As I mentioned earlier, <span class="badge">Sumi Didi</span> was both
                <span class="chip-warn">strict</span> and <span class="chip-good">soft</span> at the same time.
                She played a vital role in shaping my thoughts about good and bad habits.
                Before I ever heard of <span class="glow">James Clear</span>, she was the one guiding me.
                For instance, when I watched movies, her influence made me overthink them to the point where I stopped
                watching.
                I never smoked in my life, and that was largely because of her guidance.
                She shaped me into the kind of man I aspired to be.
            </p>

            <p>
                Her husband, <span class="badge">Santosh Kumar Sahoo</span>, worked as a clerk in the SP office in
                <span class="hash">Angul</span>. He was a remarkable figure in our family.
                No one could match his <span class="chip-good">simplicity</span> and calm demeanor.
                Humble by nature, he had never consumed alcohol or even touched products like
                <span class="marker">Safal Pan Masala</span> in his entire life.
                He was a living example of all things <span class="chip-good">good</span> for our family.
            </p>

            <p>
                They had two sons: <span class="badge">Subhranshu</span>, often called
                <span class="badge">Subhi</span>, and <span class="badge">Shreyash</span>, known as
                <span class="badge">Shreya</span>.
                <span class="badge">Subhi</span> was one of the brightest children in the family.
                He was incredibly disciplined about his studies, hated missing school, and was always engrossed in
                something
                <span class="chip-good">productive</span>—whether it was drawing, reading, or completing his homework.
                Despite his seriousness about academics, he was also funny and mischievous.
                <span class="badge">Shreya</span>, on the other hand, was slightly less focused on studies but had the
                potential
                to excel. He grasped concepts well but lost interest quickly, which made him forget things over time.
                I often helped him with his homework and other schoolwork, and I heard my fair share of complaints about
                his studies.
                Whenever he got distracted, I noticed it and reported it to my sister.

                I felt a great sense of responsibility for him.
                If I suspected he was doing something he shouldn’t, I worried endlessly,
                fearing the consequences and blaming myself for not taking better care of him.
                Thankfully, he rarely got into serious trouble and seldom argued with me.
                When I spent time with him, I tried to strike a balance between play and study.
                Sometimes, I even had to discipline him to ensure he stayed on track,
                but all of it was for his <span class="chip-good">betterment</span>.

                I didn’t talk much with <span class="badge">Lipi Dee</span>, and I didn’t have many childhood memories
                with her.
                Her husband, <span class="badge">Jogendra Sahu</span>, whom we called <span class="badge">Rulu</span>,
                was a <span class="chip-good">software engineer</span> and <span class="mono">Python developer</span>.
                They lived in <span class="hash">Bangalore</span> and had a son, <span class="badge">Duhitesh</span>,
                whom we lovingly called <span class="badge">Piyush</span>.
                <span class="badge">Piyush</span> was just as mischievous as <span class="badge">Subhi</span>.
                He loved <span class="chip-good">video games</span>, and I had seen his mother’s phone packed with them.
                He was also very fond of <span class="marker">cars</span> and toys.
                <span class="badge">Sumi Didi</span> often engaged him during video calls by showing him toys and
                encouraging him to chat.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="badge">Rulu Uncle</span> was a significant figure in our family,
                and my parents had high expectations of him.
                We all believed he might help me secure a job in the future.
                He was known for his <span class="chip-warn">strict</span> nature and didn’t hesitate to teach you a
                lesson
                if you had made a mistake or failed to follow his advice.

                My grandfather was married to two women, but such was the distance this generation had created that I
                didn’t even
                know their names while writing this book. One night, I asked my mother, and she told me their names:
                <span class="badge">Sankar Sahu</span> and <span class="badge">Uttama Sahu</span>.
                My grandfather and his two wives were a part of a history I never witnessed—I had never seen my first
                grandmother
                or my grandfather. After their time, I had <span class="badge">Asha Sahu</span>, whom I called
                <span class="inverse">“Bantala Aii”</span> because she lived with my elder father in Bantala back then.
                It had been 6–8 years since she also joined her husband in heaven.
                Her passing coincided with <span class="underline">Prathamastami</span>,
                a day that now carried a deep sense of <span class="chip-bad">loss</span> for our family.
                It was believed that we boys, and the generations to follow, would not celebrate this day unless a child
                was born
                on the same day, breaking the cycle of grief.

            <h4>School Friends</h4>
            <p>
                Family felt incomplete without friends.
                <span class="badge">Samir</span> was my all-time <span class="chip-good">best friend</span>,
                while <span class="badge">Siba</span> had a passion for <span class="underline">math</span>.
                <span class="badge">Dinesh</span> was our <span class="chip-good">leader</span> during primary school,
                and <span class="badge">Raja</span> was known for causing <span class="chip-bad">disturbances</span> in
                and out of class.
                <span class="badge">Krushna</span> had excellent <span class="underline-strong">batting skills</span>,
                and <span class="badge">Pritam</span> was focused on <span class="chip-good">earning</span> and
                <span class="chip-good">saving money</span>.
                <span class="badge">Siku</span> was my <span class="chip-good">second favorite friend</span> in school.
                Though I had many friends, these played a <span class="glow">special role</span> in my life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Among my female friends, <span class="badge">Tuin</span> stood out as the
                <span class="chip-good">class topper</span> from the beginning until the end of school.
                <span class="badge">Kajal</span> held many memories filled with <span class="chip-good">silly</span>,
                <span class="chip-good">childish</span> moments.
                <span class="badge">Titly</span>, <span class="badge">Rajashree</span>,
                <span class="badge">Aliva</span>, <span class="badge">Sarita</span>, and
                <span class="badge">Sibani</span> were also there for me from primary school to matric.
                Everything felt good until <span class="chip-bad">tragedy</span> struck—
                my best friend <span class="badge">Samir</span>
                <span class="chip-bad">passed away</span> in <span class="hash">September 2024</span> due to
                <span class="marker">sickling</span>.
                That was the <span class="shadow-box">darkest day</span> of my life, one I never forgot.
                Stick with me to uncover what really happened.
            </p>

            <p>
                These friends also influenced a <span class="chip-warn">critical phase</span> of my life during
                <span class="hash">2020</span>.
                So what actually happened was...
